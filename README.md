# Team Profile Generator Project  
   ## Description 
   The purpose of this project was to create a command line application using Node, to generate an html file with different roles based on the user input. I used classses as templates 
   for the object creation from the user inputs, the classes had to be run through tests using jest. 

   From this project I have further developed my skills in developing command line applications using node, using asynchronous code as well  as using jest for testing.
